## **Kickstarter Campaign Outcomes Based on Launch Dates and Funding Goals**

### Overview of Project

#### The purpose of this project is to analyze how different crowdfunding campaigns for plays faired in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

### Analysis and Challenges

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- A new column was created in the Kickstarter worksheet and was named "Years"
- A pivot table was created with "Parent Category" and "Years" as filters; "outcomes" as both column and values; and "date created conversion" as rows.
- The challenge encountered with this analysis was that, in the row column, when "date created converted" was chosen, the pivot table created included also the years and quarters instead of just the month of the year.
- I was able to fix this by dragging the "year" and "quarter" out of the row field so only the months show in the output
- The pivot table was filtered in Parent category to theater
- The pivot table was also filtered in the setting section to not include "live" from the output
- A line chart was created from the pivot table.  The line chart shows the trends of successfull, failed, and canceled campaigns based on the month of launch date.
- Unnecessary labels were taken out from the chart.
#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


#### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

### Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
